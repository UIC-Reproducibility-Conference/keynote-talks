# Preliminaries

In this talk, I refer to the open and reproducible research ecosystem as **open science**.
  - This is inaccurate, because there are many fields of research that are outside science.
  
---

An **open, reproducible research ecosystem** requires new expecations and modes of thinking about what research is, how it is done, and how it is rewarded.

---
# A Personal Story

Once upon a time, I tried to replicate the results in a (computational) paper.

1. I contacted the authors, but did not receive sample data or code, only the values of a few parameters and a reference to one of the software packages that was used.
2. After failing to replicate the results, my research group identified other issues with the paper.
3. We wrote up our findings, but were unable to get it published in the original venue.

---
# Lessons Learned

* replicating papers is a lot of work (even when it is all computational)
* not having data and code wastes time
* a lot of things have to go right for replications (failed or not) to be published - journals, editors, and publishers are not always motivated to do so
  - in our case, the original authors were asked to give technical commentary on our work, and this was seen by and accepted as fact by reviewers

---
# What I Care About

1. Research should be transparent and documented.
2. All contributions to a project should be recognized and rewarded. (e.g. data sources, data collection, software, methods development, etc.)

--

i.e. as few barriers as possible for participation in scholarship.

---
# Roadmap?

404 Not Found

???

I wish I could say that I have a straightforward plan, like a "10 simple rules" paper, but that would be a lie.

# Open Science is a buffet

via @chbergma

Open Science encompasses many different actions, and influences and is influenced by many factors in research.

---
# Navigating the path to Open Science

Researchers are not monolithic! We all have different starting points, different goals that we strive for, and different preferred approaches for reaching those destinations.

---
# 

It's dangerous out there, don't go alone.

---
# The Rest of the Talk

1. Core elements of reproducibility.
2. Ways to engage with reproducibility.
3. Resources for taking initial steps.

# Core Elements

# Documentation

# Metadata

**metadata** - data that describes other data.

# Metadata

**metadata** - data that describes other data.

### Accurate metadata is important!

Datafiles should have documentation that describe:
* which project the data is for
* who/what/when/where/how the data were collected
* data structure, measurement units, etc.

# Approaches

---

# What do you want to achieve?

* Mastering skills and tools for reproducibility
* Creating work that anyone can reproduce
* Reproducibility as a career requirement (funding, publication, jobs)

---

Target specific skills and tools to learn and practice.

Identify goals, and develop a plan. 

Work from standards or help create standards

# Resources

# Identify your power/privilege

Everyone has *different* capabilities to engage in change (more on this later)

* job precarity
* tradeoffs with learning new skills
* tradeoffs with deviating from status quo
* academic status, power, positions
* biases and prejudice

---
# Implementation Actions

Different levels of scale
* personal -> lab group -> field / professional society -> all of research

Different aspects of research
* research design
* data
* code, analysis, methods
* publications

---
# Where to start

(philosophy focus on transparency)

tools and actions for individual actions

resources:
repro4everyone

contacts:
librarians
data management

---
# Learning Communities

* You can learn and grow in a group.  
  You don't have to do everything yourself!
* A group provides social norms and accountability.  
  Dedicated time/space for learning, and goal-setting.
* Communities do not have be about reproducibility!  
  Learning skills or specific tools is helpful, too.

examples:
* ReproducibiliTea
* The Carpentries
* R4DS Online Community

---
# ReproducibiliTea Journal Club


---
# The Carpentries

---
# R4DS Online Community

---
# Find new research areas:

metascience
evidence synthesis

---
# Document Everything!

* 
* 
* 

---
# Lab Manuals

* Share institutional/organizational knowledge
* Reduced barriers for academic "Hidden Curriculum"

# Beyond Individual Actions

---
# Creating Change

An **open, reproducible research ecosystem** requires culture change. How can individual researches push things along?

--

.center[*If the problem is limited power, then the answer is to acquire more power.*]

--

~~Become a supervillain~~

--

**Collective action is a solution to limited individual power.**

---
# Avenues for Advocacy

* Professional Societies (e.g. SIPS)
* Journals
* Other groups (e.g. FORRT, SORTEE)

Guiding Questions:
* Are they creating standards?
* Are the standards clear, verifiable, and enforced?
