# Implementation Pathways for an Open and Reproducible Research Ecosystem

## Talk logistics

* expertise and advocacy for reproducible and open research
* one-hour session, 40 minutes presentation, 20 minutes Q&A
* Wednesday, November 3, 2021, 1000 ET (0900 CT)

## Outline

### title slide

### Preliminaries

* refer to open and reproducible research ecosystem as "open science"
  - there are many fields and activities that are not science, but this is the common moniker

### Open Science is a buffet

Open Science encompasses many different research activities, and is also touches upon many aspects in research.

### My personal motivations

"Open source practices can shift power" - Abigail Cabunoc Mayes

Things I want:
* researchers to have more agency to do their work well.
* researchers to receive appropriate credit for their work.
* researchers to not be limited by anything that isn't actually about their ability (e.g. race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, geography, access to {mentors, education, "prestigious" institutions}, etc.)

--

Note: access to education is not the same as education! Researchers do need training and some technical ability; The problem is using heuristics, most (all?) of which are biased

### Identify your own motivations

What do you care about?

* making your work "better"
* increasing the impact of your work
* acknowledging all types of work and contributors
* making publicly-funded research public

### Identify your power/privilege

Everyone has *different* capabilities to engage in change (more on this later)

* job precarity
* tradeoffs with learning new skills
* tradeoffs with deviating from status quo
* academic status, power, positions
* biases and prejudice

### Implementation Actions

Different levels of scale
* personal -> lab group -> field / professional society -> all of research

Different aspects of research
* research design
* data
* code, analysis, methods
* publications

### Where to start

{[many slides]}


### Projects & Initiatives

* collective action is a solution to limited individual power

### Open & Reproducibility groups



### Ethical Frameworks
