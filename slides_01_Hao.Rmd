# Preliminaries

In this talk, I will refer to open and reproducible research ecosystem as "open science".
  - This is not strictly accurate, there are many fields and activities that are not science.

---
# A Personal Story

Once upon a time, I tried to replicate the results in a (computational) paper.

1. I contacted the authors, but did not receive sample data or code, only the values of a few parameters and a reference to one of the software packages that was used.
2. After failing to replicate the results, my research group identified other issues with the paper.
3. We wrote up our findings, but were unable to get it published in the original venue.

---
# Lessons Learned

* replicating papers is a lot of work (even when it is all computational)
* not having data and code wastes time
* editors, journals, publishers *mostly* do not care about replications or failed replications
  - in our case, the original authors were asked to give technical commentary on our failed replication (this was not seen as a COI)

---
# What I Care About

1. Research should be transparent and well-documented
2. All contributions to a project should be recognized and rewarded. (e.g. data sources, data collection, software, methods development, etc.)

# Roadmap?

404 Not Found

???

I wish I could say that I have a straightforward plan, like a "10 simple rules" paper, but that would be a lie.

---
# The Landscape

* Expectations are changing...
  - but no one has agreed on what they are
* Practices are changing...
  - but we don't have agreed-upon standards
* Lots of groups have expressed interest...  
  but not always to researcher benefit

# Open Science is a buffet

via @chbergma

Open Science encompasses many different actions, and influences and is influenced by many factors in research.

Find what it means to you, and in what ways you can choose what you want to do.

---
# The Rest of the Talk

1. Different motivations and approaches to reproducibility.
2. Resources for engaging with reproducibility

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Motivations

---
# What do you want to achieve?

* Mastering skills and tools for reproducibility
* Creating work that anyone can reproduce
* Reproducibility as a career requirement (funding, publication, jobs)

---

Target specific skills and tools to learn and practice.

Identify goals, and develop a plan. 

Work from standards or help create standards

# Resources

### Identify your power/privilege

Everyone has *different* capabilities to engage in change (more on this later)

* job precarity
* tradeoffs with learning new skills
* tradeoffs with deviating from status quo
* academic status, power, positions
* biases and prejudice

### Implementation Actions

Different levels of scale
* personal -> lab group -> field / professional society -> all of research

Different aspects of research
* research design
* data
* code, analysis, methods
* publications

### Where to start

(philosophy focus on transparency)

tools and actions for individual actions

resources:
repro4everyone

contacts:
librarians
data management

learning communities:
advocacy groups
reproducibiliTea
communities of practice

advocacy:
professional society
repro groups (FORRT, SIPS)

research areas:
metascience
evidence synthesis

lab group and departmental training


### Projects & Initiatives

* collective action is a solution to limited individual power

### Open & Reproducibility groups
